                <h4>Understanding</h4>
                <p>This medication is used to <a href="https://apxpharma.org/product-category/pct-products/">treat hormonal imbalances</a> and neurological disorders. This product works by imitating the effects of dopamine in the brain. This helps regulate the production of prolactin, a vital hormone in different bodily functions. The medication is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_agonist"> dopamine agonist</a> and is commonly used in medical practice. This type of medication targets dopamine receptors in the brain to regulate prolactin production</p>
                <p>Parkinson’s disease affects movement and muscle control and is a progressive neurological disorder. Stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain is a treatment option that improves motor function and reduces symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement in patients. This treatment is also used in the management of Parkinson’s disease.</p>
